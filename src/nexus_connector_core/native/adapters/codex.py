"""Codex ``app-server`` connector - the D6 leg of the harness transport port.

Implements the Core-owned synchronous harness connector port against
``codex app-server`` (codex-cli 0.144.6, JSON-RPC 2.0 over child stdio; see
``docs/design/0004-harness-integrations.md`` D6 and
``docs/harness-integrations/evidence/`` for the protocol facts this module
was written against). This is the ADAPTER edge D2 calls for: every codex
method name, param shape and event name below is native vocabulary that
stops here - the domain (``domain/harness.py``) never sees a ``threadId``,
a ``turnId`` or a string like ``"turn/completed"`` except carried opaquely
in :attr:`~nexus_connector_core.native.adapter_types.HarnessEvent.native_event`.

Param and event shapes were read directly off
``codex app-server generate-json-schema`` against the installed 0.144.6
binary (not re-derived from the ADR's prose), so property names
(``threadId``, ``expectedTurnId``, the ``sandbox``/``approvalPolicy``
fields on ``thread/start``, ...) are exact, not guessed.

Threading model (no asyncio): :class:`HarnessConnector` is a synchronous
Protocol, so a private event loop thread would buy nothing. This module
uses ``subprocess.Popen`` plus two daemon reader threads (stdout, stderr) -
the same shape ``tests/conftest.py``'s ``real_server`` fixture (EV-INF-001)
uses to drain a child's pipes without deadlocking on a full buffer.
``readline()`` blocking on a pipe is not polling; nothing in this module
sleeps in a loop or re-polls a flag, so ``SleepPollWaiter`` (D1) has no
reason to appear here and does not (see
``tests/test_harness_codex_connector.py`` for a structural check).
:meth:`CodexAppServerConnector.events` is the one deliberate exception:
it blocks on a BOUNDED ``Queue.get(timeout=_EVENTS_POLL_S)`` and re-checks
a shutdown flag on each timeout, rather than an unbounded ``get()`` woken by
a single-consumption sentinel - see that method's docstring and mismatch
note 9 for the defect this fixed (a sentinel only one generator instance
can ever observe, found in review to hang a second caller of ``events()``
forever). Every other blocking wait in this module - the handshake, every
correlated ``request()``, the stdin write lock, the reader thread's own
``proc.wait()`` on exit - is likewise bounded with an explicit timeout, per
the same standing rule.

See the module docstring's "Known protocol-to-port mismatches" section
(bottom of this file) for every place codex's real shape does not fit the
frozen port cleanly - reported instead of smoothed over, per instructions.

class CodexAppServerConnector:
    """``codex app-server`` connector - implements ``HarnessConnector`` (D6).

    ONE instance owns ONE ``codex app-server`` child process and MULTIPLEXES
    every session started against it over that single stdio connection
    (``capabilities.multiplexes_sessions=True``), demuxing inbound events by
    ``threadId``/``turnId`` (ADR 0004 D6). :meth:`start` therefore does NOT
    spawn a new child per call - only the FIRST call spawns the process and
    performs the ``initialize`` handshake; every subsequent call issues a
    ``thread/start`` on the SAME connection. See the module's mismatch note
    "multiplexes_sessions has no expression in the port" for why this is an
    implicit contract rather than something the Protocol states.

    Every ``thread/start`` defaults to ``approvalPolicy="on-request"`` and
    ``sandbox="read-only"``. Only an explicitly approved runtime profile
    may override those controls. The approval bridge is tracked separately;
    an unsupported native request currently gets an explicit protocol error.
    Sandbox request values use the native string form.

        ``self._transport`` is assigned ONLY after ``initialize`` succeeds

        ``self._transport`` set" - assigning it earlier meant a failed/timed-
        out handshake left a non-``None`` transport behind, so every FUTURE
        ``start()`` skipped re-spawning entirely and fired ``thread/start``
        straight at a connection that never finished initializing,
        permanently wedging the connector. On failure here the half-spawned
        transport (and its child process) is torn down before the exception
        propagates, so a subsequent ``start()`` call gets a clean respawn.

        RES-A4 fix (mirrors ``harness/pi.py``'s own C3 fix): this failure
        path used to call ``transport.close()`` only - that sets the
        TRANSPORT's own private ``_closed`` flag (suppresses ITS
        ``on_child_exit`` callback), never this CONNECTOR's separate
        ``_closed_event``, which is the ONE flag :meth:`events` actually
        checks on every ``queue.Empty``. A caller of :meth:`events` after a
        failed :meth:`start` (with no separate, explicit :meth:`close` call)
        was therefore never told to stop - the generator looped forever.
        FIX: the ``except`` clause now also sets ``self._closed_event``, and
        the guarded region was widened to cover ``transport.start()`` itself
        (not just the handshake request), catching ``BaseException`` rather
        than ``Exception`` - the same "every way this can fail must still
        leave events() terminable" widening pi.py's own note 10(c) applies.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Known protocol-to-port mismatches (reported, not smoothed over)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# 1. ``multiplexes_sessions=True`` has no expression in ``HarnessConnector``.
#    The Protocol's ``start()`` returns ONE ``HarnessSession`` and there is
#    no "attach a new session to this already-running connector" method
#    distinct from ``start()``. This connector resolves it by making
#    ``start()`` idempotent-on-the-process (spawn+initialize once, lazily,
#    on the FIRST call) and non-idempotent-on-the-thread (every call issues
#    a fresh ``thread/start``) - an implicit contract the port's docstrings
#    do not state anywhere.
#
# 2. Connection-scoped events have no session to attribute to. ``error``,
#    ``account/*``, ``skills/changed``, ``deprecationNotice``,
#    ``configWarning``, ``app/list/updated`` (and friends) carry NO
#    ``threadId``, but ``HarnessEvent`` REQUIRES a ``session_id``. This
#    connector fans such an event out to every currently-live session on
#    the connector. The residual hole: with ZERO live sessions (e.g. a
#    connection-level auth error before any ``thread/start`` completes),
#    the event has nowhere to go and is dropped. There is no session-less
#    event sink in the port to hand it to instead.
#
# 3. ``EVENT_KINDS`` has 5 members against ~68 real codex notification
#    methods (``turn/diff/updated``, ``turn/plan/updated``,
#    ``thread/tokenUsage/updated``, ``item/started``, ``item/completed``,
#    every ``item/commandExecution/*``/``item/fileChange/*`` variant, ...).
#    All of these collapse into the ``tool_activity`` bucket; only
#    ``native_event`` preserves which one actually happened. A supervisor
#    that branches only on ``kind`` cannot tell a file-change diff from a
#    plan update from a rate-limit notice without also reading
#    ``native_event`` - this is real information loss the port's closed
#    vocabulary forces, not an oversight in this adapter.
#
# 4. ``COMMAND_VERBS`` includes ``end``; codex ``app-server`` has no
#    ``thread/end`` (or any single method that means it). The closest real
#    methods are ``thread/unsubscribe`` (stop receiving updates - reversible,
#    non-destructive), ``thread/archive`` and ``thread/delete``
#    (destructive). Because ONE connector multiplexes MANY sessions over
#    ONE child process, ending a single session must never tear down that
#    shared process - only ``close()`` (not part of the port; a connector
#    lifecycle method) does that, when the LAST session is done with it.
#    This connector interrupts an observed active turn, awaits its matching
#    terminal under a deadline, then sends ``thread/unsubscribe`` and marks the
#    session locally ended. A missing terminal leaves close_unconfirmed true.
#    It does not call ``thread/archive`` or
#    ``thread/delete``, since those destroy the codex-side rollout, which
#    ``end`` has no documented licence to do.
#
# 5. ``SESSION_STATUSES``' transition table has no ``STARTING -> ENDED``.
#    If the child process dies (or the connection drops) before a thread's
#    first ``turn/started`` ever arrives, the only legal terminal status
#    for that session is ``ERRORED`` - a clean, deliberate early
#    ``thread/unsubscribe``/shutdown on a session that never ran a turn has
#    no legal STARTING-origin path to ``ENDED`` in the table. This
#    connector does not attempt to paper over that; it is a gap for the
#    supervisor's transition logic to account for, not something fixable
#    at the adapter edge.
#
# 6. ``interrupt_requires_settle_wait=False`` for codex means the port
#    permits a supervisor to fire ``turn/start`` (or ``turn/steer``)
#    immediately after ``turn/interrupt`` with no wait. Whether codex's
#    real ``app-server`` accepts a same-millisecond follow-up request
#    against a thread whose interrupt has not yet settled was NOT exercised
#    by any live run behind this module (D6's own open questions list this
#    as unverified) - the declaration matches ADR 0004's instruction, not
#    an empirical proof of codex's tolerance for it.
#
# 7. An "unwaited" response is not a "discarded" response. D2's headline
#    claim - "send() returns no correlated reply for ANY transport" - is
#    about what the CALLER awaits, not about whether the wire ever sends
#    one back. Codex answers every request it receives, including the
#    fire-and-forget ones this connector issues for ``turn/start``,
#    ``turn/steer`` and ``turn/interrupt``. A late ERROR response to one of
#    those has no other producer in the protocol (no notification restates
#    "your turn/start was rejected"), so this connector still correlates
#    fire-and-forget request ids internally, purely to convert a late error
#    into a ``HarnessEvent(kind="error")`` instead of silently losing it -
#    a success response is discarded as redundant with the native
#    notification stream, but an error is never dropped on the floor.
#
# 8. The generated JSON Schema (``codex app-server generate-json-schema``)
#    is not a reliable guide to REQUEST shapes, only response/definition
#    shapes - proven, not assumed. ``ThreadStartParams.sandbox`` was read
#    off the schema as the tagged object ``{"type": "dangerFullAccess"}``
#    (that IS what a ``thread/start`` RESPONSE echoes back under
#    ``sandbox``). Sending that same object as the REQUEST value was
#    rejected live with ``-32600 Invalid request: unknown variant \`type\`,
#    expected one of \`read-only\`, \`workspace-write\`,
#    \`danger-full-access\``` - the request wants the bare dash-case
#    string. This connector sends the string (matching the ADR's own
#    ``-s danger-full-access`` spelling) and was re-verified end-to-end
#    against the LAN backend (D5) after the fix: ``initialize`` ->
#    ``thread/start`` -> ``turn/start`` -> the full
#    ``turn/started``/``item/*``/``item/agentMessage/delta``/
#    ``turn/completed`` notification sequence, with a real model reply.
#    A second, smaller instance of the same class of mismatch:
#    ``thread/started`` (unlike every other thread-scoped notification)
#    has NO top-level ``threadId`` - its thread id is nested at
#    ``params.thread.id``, confirmed in the same live capture. Both
#    corrections are load-bearing; a strict schema-only implementation
#    would have shipped broken on the very first ``thread/start`` call.
#
# 9. DEFECTS FOUND IN REVIEW, FIXED - recorded because a second connector in
#    this same codebase (``harness/pi.py``) independently shipped the exact
#    same shutdown-signalling bug, and because this file's own reader thread
#    had a second, worse defect stacked on top of it. Both concern
#    :meth:`CodexAppServerConnector.events`:
#
#    (a) The first version pushed a single ``_SHUTDOWN`` sentinel object
#        into ``_event_queue`` from ``close()``/``_on_child_exit`` and
#        looped on an UNBOUNDED ``_event_queue.get()``. A plain ``Queue``
#        sentinel is SINGLE-CONSUMPTION: only the ONE generator instance
#        whose ``get()`` happens to dequeue it ever sees it. A second call
#        to ``events()`` after shutdown (a fresh consumer, or the same
#        caller invoking it twice) would hang forever with no timeout and
#        no way out. FIX (mirrors ``harness/pi.py``'s own note 9): shutdown
#        is now a ``threading.Event`` (``_closed_event``), checked on every
#        ``queue.Empty`` from a ``Queue.get(timeout=_EVENTS_POLL_S)``
#        (currently 1.0s) instead of encoded as an item IN the queue at
#        all - EVERY caller, called ANY number of times, from ANY thread,
#        now observes shutdown within one poll period. Real events are
#        still delivered the instant they are pushed (D1's "no polling for
#        events" is preserved); only the IDLE-shutdown-detection path is
#        bounded-and-rechecked instead of unbounded.
#
#    (b) ``_CodexTransport._read_stdout``'s loop called ``self._dispatch(msg)``
#        with NO exception guard. A JSON-RPC-LEGAL but domain-invalid
#        notification (e.g. ``{"method": "", "params": {}}`` -
#        ``HarnessEvent.__post_init__`` rejects an empty ``native_event``;
#        or ``params`` as a JSON ARRAY, which JSON-RPC 2.0 explicitly
#        permits and which made ``_extract_thread_id``'s ``params.get()``
#        raise ``AttributeError``) made ``_dispatch`` raise. The exception
#        unwound into the ``finally`` block's ``self._proc.wait()``, called
#        with NO TIMEOUT while the child was still alive and healthy - the
#        reader thread blocked there forever, ``_on_child_exit`` was never
#        reached, no shutdown signal ever fired, and stdout stopped being
#        drained (a pipe-fill deadlock once the child's own stdout buffer
#        filled). FIX: ``_dispatch`` is now called inside its own
#        ``try/except``; a failure is surfaced as a
#        ``HarnessEvent(kind="error", native_event="transport/dispatch_error")``
#        (the callback itself is ALSO guarded, so a failure in reporting the
#        failure cannot re-wedge the loop) and the reader keeps draining
#        stdout. ``proc.wait()`` in the ``finally`` block is now bounded by
#        ``_PROC_WAIT_TIMEOUT_S`` regardless, per the standing rule below.
#
# 10. STANDING RULE, applied throughout this module after the review that
#     found 9(b): every blocking wait has an explicit timeout and raises (or
#     otherwise surfaces) a clear signal on expiry, rather than relying on
#     an assumption that the other side will always respond promptly. This
#     covers ``_CodexTransport._write``'s ``_write_lock`` acquisition
#     (previously a bare ``with``, unbounded if a concurrent write were
#     stuck on a full pipe - now ``acquire(timeout=_STDIN_WRITE_LOCK_TIMEOUT_S)``,
#     raising ``INTERNAL_ERROR`` on expiry) and the reader thread's own
#     ``proc.wait()`` noted in 9(b). ``request()`` and ``events()`` were
#     already bounded before this review; nothing there changed.
#
# 11. ``_end()`` used to POP the thread_id mapping from ``_sessions_by_thread``
#     synchronously, while the turn that was already in flight when ``end()``
#     was called kept emitting ``turn/started``/``item/*``/``turn/completed``
#     notifications for that SAME thread_id afterward. ``_emit_for_thread``
#     treated any unmapped thread_id identically to the "``thread/started``
#     raced ``thread/start``'s response" early-event case (mismatch note
#     above) and buffered it into ``_unmapped_thread_events`` - a dict only
#     ever drained by ``start()`` re-registering that EXACT thread_id, which
#     never happens again since thread ids are never reused. Ending a
#     session as soon as it is no longer needed (an ordinary sequence, e.g.
#     cancelling right as a turn finishes) silently and permanently dropped
#     that turn's own completion and leaked one dict entry per such session,
#     forever, for the life of the connector process. FIX: ``_end()`` no
#     longer pops the ``_sessions_by_thread`` mapping (only
#     ``state.ended = True``); trailing events for an ended thread now keep
#     resolving through the normal ``_emit_for_thread`` -> ``_push_event``
#     path instead of being mis-routed into the early-event buffer, so a
#     supervisor still observes the turn's real completion. This is a
#     deliberate DELIVER reading, not a DROP one: the trailing events are
#     real, already-in-flight observations the child produced before this
#     connector asked it to stop, and ``send()`` already rejects any FURTHER
#     command against ``state.ended``, so nothing can be issued against a
#     session that looks live but isn't.
#
# 12. ``_spawn_and_initialize`` used to set ``self._transport = transport``
#     BEFORE calling ``transport.request(_METHOD_INITIALIZE, ...)``. If that
#     request raised (a handshake timeout or a rejected ``initialize``), the
#     exception propagated out of ``start()``, but ``self._transport`` was
#     already non-``None``. ``start()``'s own spawn guard
#     (``if self._transport is None: self._spawn_and_initialize()``) then
#     skipped respawning entirely on every SUBSEQUENT ``start()`` call,
#     firing ``thread/start`` straight at a connection whose handshake never
#     completed - permanently wedging the connector after one bad handshake,
#     with no recovery short of constructing a brand-new instance. The
#     half-spawned child was also never reaped. A dead, write-only
#     ``self._initialized`` flag (grep-confirmed: set in two places, read
#     nowhere) sat next to this bug looking like it gated something; it did
#     not. FIX: ``self._transport`` is assigned only AFTER ``initialize``
#     succeeds; a failure closes (and thereby reaps) the half-spawned
#     transport before re-raising, so the NEXT ``start()`` call gets a clean
#     respawn. The dead ``self._initialized`` flag was removed rather than
#     wired up, since nothing in this connector needs it once the guard
#     above is correct.
#
# 13. ``_emit_for_thread``'s lookup of ``_sessions_by_thread.get(thread_id)``
#     was done under ``_sessions_lock``, but the subsequent append to
#     ``_unmapped_thread_events`` (for a genuinely-unmapped thread_id) ran
#     UNLOCKED, while ``start()`` registers the mapping AND pops
#     ``_unmapped_thread_events`` in the SAME lock acquisition. A
#     registration landing in the gap between the unlocked lookup and the
#     unlocked append could pop an as-yet-empty buffer, after which the
#     append lands - and that event is buffered forever, never replayed:
#     the exact race the buffer/replay mechanism exists to prevent. FIX:
#     the lookup and the (conditional) append now share ONE
#     ``_sessions_lock`` acquisition, matching ``start()``'s own scope, so
#     the two can no longer interleave.
#
# 14. TWO DEFECTS FOUND BY THE PHASE-4 CAMPAIGN'S DEFECT-WITNESS TESTS
#     (RES-A2, RES-A4), FIXED THIS PASS - both are the exact same defect
#     CLASS ``harness/pi.py`` independently shipped and fixed (its own notes
#     9(b)/C2 and 10(c)/C3), reintroduced here because this module was
#     written independently of that fix:
#
#     a) RES-A2 - ``events()`` fed every caller off ONE shared
#        ``queue.Queue`` (``_event_queue``, set in ``__init__``): two
#        concurrent consumers raced for the same items and the stream was
#        SPLIT between them (a deterministic partition, not a flaky race -
#        ``test_two_concurrent_events_consumers_split_the_stream_instead_of_
#        each_getting_the_full_stream`` proved it 3/3 by asserting the total
#        item count across both consumers of an N-event stream: 2N with
#        correct fan-out, exactly N with a shared-queue split). FIX: the
#        same fan-out shape as ``pi.py``'s C2 - ``_event_history`` (an
#        append-only record) plus one subscriber ``Queue`` per ``events()``
#        call, both under ``_history_lock`` so a push can never land in the
#        gap between a new subscriber's backlog snapshot and its
#        registration. ``_event_queue`` itself is gone; every push now goes
#        through ``_push_event``'s history-append-then-fan-out.
#
#        HONEST CAVEAT this fix carries, NOT present in ``pi.py``'s own
#        version of the same fix: ``pi.py`` justifies never trimming
#        ``_event_history`` by "a session's event count is bounded by its
#        own lifetime" - true there because ``multiplexes_sessions=False``
#        (one ``PiRpcConnector`` IS one session). That premise does NOT hold
#        here: ``multiplexes_sessions=True`` means ONE ``_event_history``
#        can in principle accumulate events across MANY sessions' worth of
#        turns over the connector's WHOLE process lifetime, not one
#        session's. At today's actual wiring this is not reachable
#        (``adapters/inbound/mcp/tools/harness.py``'s ``_codex`` factory
#        constructs a brand-new ``CodexAppServerConnector`` - and therefore
#        a brand-new child process - on every ``harness_open`` call, so no
#        connector instance in production currently outlives more than one
#        session; grep-confirmed, no other call site in ``src/`` re-uses a
#        connector across sessions or re-subscribes to ``events()``), but it
#        is a real, unbounded-growth latent gap the moment multiplexing is
#        ever actually wired up as ``multiplexes_sessions=True`` implies it
#        should be (see mismatch note 1) - reported here rather than
#        silently inheriting a justification whose premise is false for this
#        connector.
#
#     b) RES-A4 - ``_spawn_and_initialize``'s failure path called
#        ``transport.close()`` on a failed/timed-out handshake, but that
#        only sets the TRANSPORT's own private ``_closed`` flag (suppresses
#        ITS ``on_child_exit`` callback) - never this CONNECTOR's separate
#        ``_closed_event``, the ONE flag ``events()`` actually checks on
#        every ``queue.Empty``. A caller of ``events()`` after a failed
#        ``start()`` with no separate, explicit ``close()`` call was
#        therefore never told to stop - proved deterministically 3/3 by
#        ``test_failed_start_leaves_events_terminable`` (a child that
#        consumes the ``initialize`` write but never answers it, so the
#        handshake times out cleanly with no crash involved). FIX: the
#        ``except`` clause now also sets ``self._closed_event``, and the
#        guarded region was widened to cover ``transport.start()`` itself
#        (not just the handshake ``request()``), catching ``BaseException``
#        rather than ``Exception`` - matching how widely ``pi.py``'s own C3
#        fix guards its equivalent spawn path, so no way of failing to
#        start leaves this gap open again.
#
#     c) SECOND-ORDER DEFECT INTRODUCED BY (b) ABOVE, ALSO FIXED (found in
#        this same pass's own self-review, not by an earlier agent): setting
#        ``_closed_event`` on a failed start() and never clearing it anywhere
#        would silently poison every FUTURE successful retry on the SAME
#        connector instance - unlike ``pi.py`` (``multiplexes_sessions=
#        False``, a second ``start()`` call always raises outright), codex's
#        own mismatch note 12 explicitly promises "a subsequent ``start()``
#        call gets a clean respawn" after a failed one. Without a clear,
#        that respawn would succeed at the transport level while leaving
#        ``events()`` observing a stale "closed" flag from the EARLIER
#        failure and returning immediately on its very first idle poll -
#        proved deterministically by
#        ``test_events_stays_live_after_a_failed_start_is_followed_by_a_
#        successful_retry`` (one connector instance, one failed spawn via a
#        marker-file script that hangs on its first invocation, then a
#        successful retry via the SAME script's second invocation
#        behaving like a real minimal app-server). FIX:
#        ``_spawn_and_initialize``'s success path now clears
#        ``self._closed_event`` immediately before assigning
#        ``self._transport``. This can only fire on the failed-then-retried
#        path: this method only re-runs when ``self._transport is None``
#        (``start()``'s own guard), which a deliberate ``close()`` never
#        makes true again (``close()`` does not reset ``self._transport``),
#        so a post-``close()`` ``start()`` never reaches this line at all.
