    The runtime trips it whenever the in-memory admission fence closes

    on the loop AND inside the dispatch thread immediately before the
    native write/spawn - the closest point to the effect (RC-03-03: a
    thread that starts late must not write under stale authorization).
    Containment controls (interrupt/close) stay allowed past a lease
    deadline by contract; everything else fails closed before the write.

    C2/R03: the guard also consults the LIVE monotonic clock against the
    CURRENT lease deadline - never only a watcher flag, which is only as
    fresh as the watcher's last run. Linearization of the revoke/renew
    race: revoke publishes its flags before returning; renew replaces the
    binding context under the runtime lock. Reading the deadline first
    and the flags second is conservative under both orders - an
    extension racing this check can only delay an acceptance, never
    widen one, and an effect dispatched before a later revocation keeps
    its upstream OUTCOME_UNKNOWN handling (no exactly-once claim).
