# Modified 2026-09-25 for nexus-connector-core: application imports replaced with neutral local types.
"""Core-owned Claude Code stream-json adapter, adapted from Nexus D7a.

Implements Core's private neutral harness port for a managed Claude session:

    claude -p --output-format stream-json --input-format stream-json \\
        --verbose --include-partial-messages

This is the STABLE FLOOR of the Claude Code integration (ADR 0004 D7): if the
undocumented ``cc-socks`` attach substrate (D7b) breaks on a Claude Code
release, this connector must keep working, because it only depends on
documented, supported CLI flags. Robustness is therefore the priority over
feature completeness.

Every behavioural claim below was verified empirically against the real
``claude`` 2.1.278 binary (see the report accompanying this module's
delivery); nothing here is inferred from documentation, because none exists
for this exact input/output wire shape beyond the flag reference.

Verified facts this module encodes
-----------------------------------
* ONE process holds MANY turns on a STABLE ``session_id``: writing a second
  ``{"type":"user",...}`` line after the first turn's ``result`` reuses the
  same session. The process stays alive until stdin is closed.
* ``--include-partial-messages`` is requested UNCONDITIONALLY (not only for
  delta text). It is also the ONLY reliable signal this connector has that a
  turn has begun generating content (``stream_event`` with
  ``event.type in {"message_start","content_block_start"}``), which matters
  for the interrupt safety window below.
* ``{"type":"control_request","request":{"subtype":"interrupt"}}`` on stdin
  IS a real, working mid-session control message (distinct from - and not
  affected by - the MCP ``notifications/claude/*`` path eliminated in
  EV-CC-002). It is answered synchronously with a ``control_response`` and
  this is what makes ``steer_timing=IMMEDIATE`` achievable: ``steer`` is
  implemented as interrupt-then-resend, not as a bare queued user line (a
  bare second ``user`` line while a turn is in flight does NOT interleave -
  it is strictly queued and only runs after the current turn's ``result``,
  i.e. it is NEXT_TURN_BOUNDARY behaviour, not IMMEDIATE. Declaring
  IMMEDIATE while only ever writing a bare queued line would be exactly the
  "capability lie" EV-INF-002 fixed for D7b's ``steer_timing`` - see the
  requesting-phase control note below).
* **A genuine race window makes ``interrupt`` fatal to the whole process if
  fired too early.** Interrupting a turn that has been submitted but has not
  yet produced its first ``stream_event`` (still in the CLI's internal
  "requesting" phase) crashes the process: it answers the
  ``control_response`` normally, then emits
  ``{"type":"result","subtype":"error_during_execution"}`` and EXITS(1) -
  the session does not survive. Interrupting an IDLE connector (no turn
  submitted at all) is safe. Interrupting AFTER the first
  ``message_start``/``content_block_start`` stream event is also safe: the
  turn ends with the same ``error_during_execution`` result but the process
  and session survive for further turns, and a reprompt sent immediately
  (no artificial delay) is honoured correctly - i.e.
  ``interrupt_requires_settle_wait=False`` holds. This connector therefore
  gates every interrupt it issues on having observed generation start for
  the CURRENT turn (see ``_turn_generating``), which is the only way to
  earn ``steer_timing=IMMEDIATE`` without periodically crashing the peer.
* Malformed input is fatal in a way genuinely unlike a normal harness error:
  a syntactically invalid JSON line, OR valid JSON missing the expected
  ``message`` shape, makes the CLI print to stderr and exit(1) IMMEDIATELY -
  any further already-queued valid lines are never processed. An unknown
  *top-level* ``"type"`` value, by contrast, is silently ignored (exit 0,
  no stderr). This connector never emits the former (it fully controls
  outbound serialisation and validates ``payload["content"]`` before
  writing), and treats the latter as a documented version-drift hazard on
  the SEND side.
* ``system``/``init`` re-fires before EVERY turn (not once at session
  start) and is this connector's ``turn_started`` signal.
* Closing stdin drains any in-flight turn and then the process exits(0)
  cleanly - the natural producer of ``observes_session_end=True``: this
  connector never synthesises an "ended" ``HarnessEvent``; the
  :meth:`events` iterator simply terminating (after any final diagnostic
  ``error`` event on an unexpected/non-zero exit) IS the end signal, exactly
  as D1/EV-INF-002 frame it for a connector that can observe an end at all.

``steer`` verified IMMEDIATE against the real binary (not just inferred)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Empirically confirmed against ``claude`` 2.1.278 (manual probe and
``test_real_claude_steer_interrupts_in_flight_turn_and_runs_new_one_
immediately``, both 2026-09-20): sending ``steer`` once a turn is observed
generating lands a real ``control_request``/``interrupt`` in well under
20ms (``control_response:success`` immediately followed by that turn's
``result:error_during_execution``), and the steered content then runs as
the next turn on the SAME process/session with no settle delay. This is
genuine IMMEDIATE redirection (interrupt-then-resend), not a bare queued
line that would only land at the next turn boundary - so
``steer_timing=IMMEDIATE`` is an honest declaration for this (safe-window)
path, not a capability lie. Earlier revisions of this module declared
IMMEDIATE on the strength of the separately-verified ``interrupt`` path
alone; no test ever drove ``send(verb='steer')`` itself against the real
binary until the above.

Requesting-phase control
------------------------
``steer``/``interrupt`` issued while a turn is in the fatal "requesting"
window are rejected before a protocol write. The caller can safely retry
with a fresh operation ID after generation is observed; the adapter neither
silently drops an interrupt nor queues a steer under an IMMEDIATE claim.

Event-vocabulary port gap (reported, not fixed - the port is FROZEN)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Core-owned event kind vocabulary has no "informational/system
notice" kind. Real, frequent native events - ``system``/``hook_started``,
``hook_response``, ``informational``, ``status``; ``rate_limit_event``;
``control_response``; the synthetic post-interrupt ``user`` echo; and the
structural (non-text-delta) ``stream_event`` sub-events - have no honest
closed-vocabulary home. Per D2/INT-03 ("unmapped native events are
surfaced, never silently dropped") this connector maps ALL of them to
``tool_activity`` as the least-wrong available bucket, carrying the real
native name in ``native_event`` and the full native envelope in ``payload``
so nothing is lost - but this is a mapping of convenience, not a claim that
these are tool calls. See the accompanying report for detail.

Threading model
----------------
:meth:`start` and :meth:`send` are SYNCHRONOUS per the frozen port (they run
on whatever thread the in-process supervisor calls them from - D1 puts that
supervisor in the same process as ``serve``'s event loop, and this module
must never block it). All child-process I/O therefore happens on two daemon
reader threads (stdout, stderr) started by :meth:`start`, exactly the shape
the port's own docstring calls out ("a thread-fed queue for child-process
stdio"). :meth:`events` hands back a generator that blocks on
``queue.Queue.get()`` - a blocking wait, never a sleep-poll loop - so no
``SleepPollWaiter`` appears anywhere in this path (D1) and the caller is
woken the instant an event is published, not on some fixed interval.
