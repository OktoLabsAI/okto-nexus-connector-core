"""Claude Code ATTACH connector: ``cc-socks`` injection into a live session.

This is the D7b substrate from ``docs/design/0004-harness-integrations.md``: a
SEND-ONLY Core-owned harness connector that injects
a message into a Claude Code INTERACTIVE session the user already has open -
the one capability D7a (``claude -p`` stream-json, which Nexus itself spawns
and owns) structurally cannot provide, because a session Nexus did not spawn
has no stream-json pipe for Nexus to hold.

Proven, not re-derived: ``docs/harness-integrations/evidence/EV-CC-001``. This
module is the adapter edge translating that private, UNDOCUMENTED wire
protocol into the Core-owned neutral harness vocabulary; nothing
here leaks into ``domain/`` or ``application/`` (``sqlite3``/``mcp`` import
boundary is irrelevant to this file, but the translation discipline is the
same one D2 asks of every connector).

Transport summary (see EV-CC-001 for the full recovery):

* One UNIX domain socket per INTERACTIVE session, discovered from the
  per-session registry file ``~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`` (field
  ``messagingSocketPath``) - NOT recomputed from the documented path-
  resolution rule. The registry is written by Claude Code itself and is
  therefore the authoritative source; the documented rule
  (``${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/cc-socks/<pid>.sock``, falling back to
  ``/tmp/cc-socks-<uid>/<pid>.sock`` past the 103-byte ``sun_path`` limit) is
  kept ONLY as a fallback for when the registry omits the field (schema
  drift), because EV-CC-001's own capture shows a plain
  ``/tmp/cc-socks/<pid>.sock`` on a box with ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` unset - i.e.
  the live fallback is NOT uid-suffixed until the 103-byte ceiling is
  actually hit. Trusting the registry field sidesteps re-deriving that edge
  case at all.
* Newline-delimited JSON, auth line REQUIRED first:
  ``{"type":"auth","token":"<peerToken>"}`` then
  ``{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":"..."}}``.
* The token lives at ``~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.<hash>.key`` (mode 0600),
  shape ``{"peerToken":...,"procStart":...,"pidDomain":...}``.
* Sends are fire-and-forget: the connection is accepted with NO synchronous
  ack. There is no reply channel on this transport at all.

Capabilities (ADR 0004 D7b): ``send_only=True``, ``steer_timing=None``,
``observes_session_end=False``, ``multiplexes_sessions=False``. The fifth
required field, ``interrupt_requires_settle_wait``, has no real answer on a
transport with no interrupt verb at all; it is set ``False`` here as "does
not apply" rather than a considered "no settle wait needed" - see the module
``__all__`` docstring note and the task report for this gap.

Security posture (the load-bearing design choice of this module): content
injected via ``cc-socks`` renders to the receiving model as an ordinary peer
chat message - this is a PROMPT-INJECTION surface, not merely a delivery
mechanism. :func:`ClaudeCodeAttachConnector.send` wraps every outbound
message in a fixed banner that (a) names Nexus and the originating Okto Nexus
agent id as the source, (b) states explicitly that the content is untrusted
external data and not a system or user instruction, and (c) neutralises any
attempt by the payload to reproduce that exact banner text and so impersonate
a second, later boundary. This is a best-effort textual convention, not a
structural boundary the receiving model is guaranteed to honour - the
transport gives us no structural separation to lean on, and the ADR is
explicit that this risk is accepted, not eliminated.

Stability posture: ``cc-socks`` is undocumented and can change shape in any
Claude Code release with no deprecation notice (ADR 0004 D7b). Every public
entry point here therefore fails LOUDLY with an actionable
:class:`~nexus_connector_core.native.adapter_types.NativeAdapterError` (never a bare exception, never a
hang, never a retry loop) and :meth:`ClaudeCodeAttachConnector.probe` exists
specifically so a supervisor can detect breakage before it ever calls
:meth:`~ClaudeCodeAttachConnector.send`.

LIMITATION 3 (this module's part of it): "the socket is missing" is only one
of several ways this protocol can break, and treating it as the only one
would miss shape changes that leave a socket present but unusable. Every
locally checkable surface is therefore probed: the registry file's shape
(including the total ABSENCE of a field this connector depends on, not
merely a bad value - see ``_read_registry``'s ``"kind"`` check), the
``peerProtocol`` version field, the key file's shape, and the socket's own
file type/ownership. ``peerFeatures`` is recorded but deliberately NOT
enforced (see ``_normalize_peer_features``) - this connector depends on no
named feature, so refusing on an unrecognised entry would only produce false
refusals. Every attach-precondition failure - everything :meth:`probe` or
:meth:`start` can raise, plus the pid-reuse guard and :meth:`send`'s own
transport-level ``OSError`` - carries a unique, machine-stable ``reason``
PLUS a coarse ``category`` (``"protocol_drift"`` / ``"no_session"`` /
``"permission"`` / ``"internal"``) so an operator can tell "Claude Code
changed its protocol" apart from "no session is running" apart from "wrong
permissions" - see :class:`ProbeResult`'s docstring for the full vocabulary.
(:meth:`send`'s three basic input-validation raises - an unsupported verb,
empty content, a session this connector never started - are ordinary
API-contract errors from NEXUS'S OWN CALLER, not cc-socks signals, and are
deliberately out of this scope.)
None of this proves a real future protocol change will be caught: it proves
that THESE specific, observable registry/key/socket shapes each produce a
distinct, attributable outcome now, and that a change landing in one of
those fields will not be silently swallowed by a generic catch-all the way
an earlier version of this module would have swallowed it.

    """Structured, never-raising outcome of a breakage check.

    Exists so a supervisor can poll ``probe()`` on an idle schedule and
    detect ``cc-socks`` breaking on a Claude Code upgrade BEFORE the next
    real ``send`` - the task's explicit "detect breakage early" requirement.
    ``reason`` is always a short, UNIQUE, machine-stable code identifying the
    SPECIFIC check that failed - e.g. ``"registry_not_found"`` is never the
    same string as ``"key_file_not_found"``, and ``"registry_malformed_json"``
    is never the same string as ``"key_file_malformed_json"``, even though an
    earlier version of this module mapped several unrelated causes onto one
    shared ``ErrorCode``-derived fallback string. ``category`` groups those
    precise codes into the four buckets an operator actually has to triage
    on, mapping directly onto the task's own three-way ask plus one more:
    ``"ok"``, ``"protocol_drift"`` (the registry/key shape moved - Claude
    Code likely changed cc-socks), ``"no_session"`` (nothing attachable at
    this pid right now - normal, not evidence of breakage), ``"permission"``
    (this OS user cannot read a file cc-socks itself wrote 0600 for this
    SAME user - an environment problem, not a protocol change) or
    ``"internal"`` (this probe's own code hit something unanticipated).
    ``detail`` is the human-actionable message.

    IMPORTANT - ``ok=True`` proves only that every LOCALLY CHECKABLE
    precondition held at probe time: registry shape, process liveness, the
    ``peerProtocol`` value (if present), key file shape, socket shape and
    ownership, and a bare connect-then-close. ``cc-socks`` has NO
    application-level ack (EV-CC-001), so this is NOT proof of delivery -
    no probe can prove that a LATER ``send()`` is actually received or
    rendered by the peer. Read ``ok=True`` as "attach preconditions look
    sound", never as "delivery is guaranteed" or "delivery will succeed".

    ``peer_protocol_verified`` is ``True`` only when the registry reported
    ``peerProtocol`` and it exactly matched the one proven value
    (``_PROVEN_PEER_PROTOCOL``), with strict integer type. Missing or malformed
    values produce ``ok=False`` and ``peer_protocol_verified=False``: there is
    no safe default for an unverified ACK-less wire format.

    ``peer_features`` is the raw ``peerFeatures`` list read from the
    registry, recorded but deliberately never enforced - see the module
    docstring's note on why gating delivery on that list was declined.

        (``except NativeAdapterError: return``) the moment that file went
        missing, relying on an untested coincidence elsewhere to stay safe.

        * the same path -> fall back to the narrower ``procStart``
          comparison (covers an in-place rewrite, and is what the existing
          test suite already exercises).

        If ``start()`` never observed a ``procStart`` at all, the final
