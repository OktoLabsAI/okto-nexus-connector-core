"""Pi ``--mode rpc`` connector - the D4 leg of the harness transport port.

Implements the Core-owned synchronous harness connector port against
``pi --mode rpc`` (pi 0.85.1, strict LF-framed JSON lines over child stdio;
see ``docs/design/0004-harness-integrations.md`` D4 and
``docs/harness-integrations/research/pi-rpc-protocol-reference.md`` /
``docs/harness-integrations/evidence/EV-PI-001-protocol-verified.md`` for the
protocol facts this module was written against - all backed by raw captured
JSONL, not re-derived from the ``pi-delegate`` plugin's docs where the two
disagree). This is the ADAPTER edge D2 calls for: every pi verb, event
``type`` and field name below is native vocabulary that stops here - the
domain (``domain/harness.py``) never sees ``"agent_settled"`` or
``"queue_update"`` except carried opaquely in
:attr:`~nexus_connector_core.native.adapter_types.HarnessEvent.native_event`.

Wire shape (verified live, not assumed from the plugin's own docs):

* Command: ``{"type": "<verb>", ...fields}``. The earlier 0.85.1 captures
  did not echo optional ``id``, so that version uses a serialized verb-based
  fallback. Installed 0.87.1 was observed echoing ``id`` on ``get_state``;
  that exact version requires ID correlation and admits bounded concurrent
  requests. Later versions remain unqualified, not assumed equivalent.
* Response: ``{"type":"response","command":"<verb>","success":bool,"data"?,
  "error"?}``.
* Framing: strict LF, one JSON object per line, no length-prefixing.
* There is NO ready/hello event. On spawn pi emits 0-7+ unsolicited
  ``extension_ui_request`` lines (UI noise from loaded extensions) before
  anything else. Readiness is "stdin accepted a write and a matching
  ``response`` envelope came back" - this connector proves that with a
  throwaway ``get_state`` probe in :meth:`PiRpcConnector.start`, never by
  waiting for the first bytes to arrive.
* It is a genuine PUSH protocol: after ``prompt``/``steer``, dozens to
  hundreds of unsolicited event lines stream on stdout with ZERO further
  client writes, until ``agent_settled`` (confirmed: 13 events for a plain
  turn, 300+ for a tool-using one with a mid-turn steer - see the protocol
  reference §4). ``events()`` below is a blocking generator fed by a
  dedicated reader thread; nothing in this module polls.
* Steering (``steer_timing=NEXT_TURN_BOUNDARY``): the internal
  ``queue_update`` fires immediately, but delivery to the model is deferred
  until the in-flight tool call's turn boundary (protocol reference §5).
* Abort/settle (``interrupt_requires_settle_wait=True``): ``agent_settled``
  for the ABORTED turn - not the ``response(abort,...)`` ack, which happens
  to arrive in the same batch but is not the semantically correct gate - is
  the only safe signal to send the next command. Getting this backwards is
  documented as "the classic hang" (protocol reference §6). Measured abort
  latency is ~2-30ms; this connector's timeouts are NOT sized to that figure
  (see the constructor's ``command_timeout_s``), only the *shape* of the
  gate (wait for ``agent_settled``, not a fixed sleep) is taken from it.
* Sessions persist across a full process kill when respawned with the same
  ``--session-id`` (protocol reference §7); see mismatch note 2 on why
  ``end`` therefore never deletes the on-disk session file.
* Malformed JSON and an unknown verb both come back as a clean
  ``{"success":false,"error":"..."}`` and the process stays alive (protocol
  reference §8). Rejected responses are surfaced as error events. A rejected
  ``prompt`` also fails the send so Core cannot journal it as submitted;
  because the request crossed the native pipe, the outcome remains uncertain.

Threading model (no asyncio, matching the sibling connectors in this
package): :class:`HarnessConnector` is a synchronous Protocol, so a private
event loop thread buys nothing. This module uses ``subprocess.Popen`` plus
two daemon reader threads (stdout, stderr) - ``readline()`` blocking on a
pipe is not polling, and every correlated wait (``_PiTransport.request``)
blocks on a single bounded ``queue.Queue.get(timeout=...)``, never a sleep
loop, so ``SleepPollWaiter`` (D1) has no reason to appear and does not (see
``tests/test_harness_pi_connector.py`` for a structural check mirroring the
codex connector's own). :meth:`PiRpcConnector.events` is the one exception
worth calling out explicitly: it blocks on a BOUNDED
``Queue.get(timeout=_EVENTS_POLL_S)`` and re-checks a shutdown flag on each
timeout, rather than an unbounded ``get()`` - this is a periodic liveness
check for SHUTDOWN, never a poll for the events themselves (a real event
still satisfies ``get()`` immediately, exactly as an unbounded wait would).
See that method's docstring and mismatch note 9 for the defect this fixed:
an earlier unbounded-``get()`` design hung for real, for 17 minutes, in
review.

One connector instance owns exactly ONE pi child process for its lifetime
(``capabilities.multiplexes_sessions=False`` - pi is one session per
process, unlike codex): :meth:`start` may be called once; a second call
raises rather than silently spawning a second child the connector has no
slot to track.

Domain-level command payload convention (not part of the frozen port, but
kept consistent with ``codex.py``'s own choice so a supervisor can
build one ``HarnessCommand`` shape for both): ``send_turn``/``steer``
read their text from ``command.payload["text"]``, translated to pi's native
``{"message": ...}`` field at the wire edge.

See the module's "Known protocol-to-port mismatches" section (bottom of this
file) for every place pi's real shape does not fit the frozen port cleanly -
reported instead of smoothed over, per instructions.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Known protocol-to-port mismatches (reported, not smoothed over)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# 1. `EVENT_KINDS` has no member for `agent_settled` - the ONE native event a
#    supervisor MUST branch on to honour `interrupt_requires_settle_wait=True`
#    (the port's own `interrupt_requires_settle_wait` docstring says exactly
#    this). This is a direct collision with `domain/harness.py`'s own claim
#    that "the domain never inspects [native_event], only carries it for
#    traceability" (D2/D4/D6/D7): here, correct supervisor behaviour is
#    IMPOSSIBLE without inspecting `native_event`. This connector maps
#    `agent_settled` -> `kind="turn_completed"` (the least-wrong bucket - it
#    IS a completion signal) but `turn_end` ALSO maps to `turn_completed` and
#    fires earlier and more often (once per intra-turn tool-continuation
#    boundary, confirmed in the protocol reference §3's tool-turn sequence)
#    than `agent_settled` (once per whole exchange). A supervisor that reacts
#    to `kind=="turn_completed"` alone to decide "safe to send the next
#    command" will send too early. This connector does NOT rely on `kind` for
#    its OWN internal settle-wait gate (`_on_push_event` checks
#    `native_type == "agent_settled"` directly) - proof that the escape hatch
#    is necessary, not merely convenient.
#
# 2. `COMMAND_VERBS` includes `end`; pi's RPC protocol has no wire verb that
#    means it (the full verified verb set is `prompt`, `steer`, `abort`,
#    `get_last_assistant_text`, `get_state`, `get_session_stats`,
#    `extension_ui_response` - protocol reference §2). Ending a pi session is
#    achieved by closing stdin / killing the process, not any command. Since
#    `multiplexes_sessions=False` (one connector IS one session, unlike
#    codex's shared child), this connector maps `end` to a FULL teardown
#    (`close()`) rather than a partial detach - there is nothing else running
#    on the process to preserve. It deliberately does NOT delete the
#    on-disk `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<cwd-slug>/<ts>_<session-id>.jsonl` file;
#    doing so would destroy the exact persist-across-process-kill property
#    proven live in protocol reference §7. "end" means "detach", not
#    "forget" - the domain has no vocabulary to distinguish those two and
#    this connector picked the non-destructive reading.
#
# 3. The older 0.85.1 raw captures had no response ID echo. That exact
#    protocol observation retains a one-command-at-a-time verb fallback and
#    fences its transport after an ambiguous write/timeout. The installed
#    0.87.1 release documents and was observed echoing the optional request
#    ID, so that exact version requires ID matching, permits up to 32
#    concurrent requests, and treats an old timed-out response as unmatched
#    rather than as a response to a newer same-verb request. Other versions
#    have not inherited 0.87.1's claim automatically.
#
# 4. `interrupt_requires_settle_wait=True` has no expression in
#    `HarnessConnector.send()`'s signature - the port docstring states send()
#    "never blocks for a reply" and there is no out-of-band channel to say
#    "not yet". This connector enforces the guard itself: `send_turn` and
#    `steer` both raise `CONFLICT` if called while an issued interrupt's
#    `agent_settled` has not yet arrived, rather than silently queuing (which
#    pi has no queue for outside of `steer`'s own next-turn-boundary
#    mechanism) or writing straight through and racing the aborted turn's
#    teardown - the exact hang protocol reference §6 calls "the classic
#    hang". A supervisor built strictly against the Protocol's type
#    signature alone has no way to learn this guard exists except by reading
#    this connector's source or catching the raised error; the port gives
#    connectors no vocabulary for "temporarily unavailable, retry after an
#    event".
#
# 5. `extension_ui_request` sits entirely outside the frozen command/event
#    vocabulary: it is neither a `COMMAND_VERB` a supervisor would issue nor
#    an occurrence a supervisor needs to react to, yet it MUST be answered on
#    the wire or (per the protocol reference) it "queues up as noise". This
#    connector now captures supported dialogs during an active turn when the
#    host enables native inputs. They retain their ID, local turn generation,
#    deadline and exact response shape. Other UI requests retain the legacy
#    cancellation fallback. Both response paths bypass the request/response
#    correlation lock entirely (mismatch 3) since a ui-response expects no
#    reply of its own and would deadlock against an in-flight `prompt`/
#    `steer`/`abort` otherwise. It is ALSO forwarded as a
#    `HarnessEvent(kind="tool_activity")` purely for traceability, per the
#    task's "handle deliberately" instruction. There is no port-level way for
#    a supervisor that does NOT want ui noise in its event stream to ask this
#    connector to suppress it.
#
# 6. `get_state`, `get_last_assistant_text` and `get_session_stats` - three
#    real, useful, side-effect-free pi verbs - have no representation in
#    `COMMAND_VERBS` at all. This connector uses `get_state` internally ONLY
#    as the readiness probe (protocol reference §1), never exposes it through
#    `send()`. A caller wanting "what did pi just say"
#    (`get_last_assistant_text`) or session stats has no port-level way to
#    ask for it short of accumulating `message_end`/`turn_end` payloads out
#    of the ordinary event stream itself.
#
# 7. `SESSION_STATUSES`' `STARTING` has no legal `STARTING -> ENDED`
#    transition (mirrors `codex.py`'s own mismatch note 5): this
#    connector's `start()` happens to never expose that gap on its own happy
#    path, because the `get_state` readiness probe is SYNCHRONOUS and
#    blocking - a dead-on-arrival child (crash before the first response) is
#    caught inside `start()` itself (which raises, never returning a
#    `HarnessSession` at all) rather than surfacing as a session stuck in
#    `STARTING` forever. It remains a live gap for the supervisor's
#    transition table in general, just not one this specific connector's
#    `start()` shape can trigger.
#
# 8. This connector's `send()` is NOT purely fire-and-forget at the wire
#    level, unlike `codex.py`'s `send_fire_and_forget` (which never
#    waits for even the ack). `_send_turn`/`_steer`/`_interrupt` all block
#    (bounded by `command_timeout_s`) on the IMMEDIATE ack response
#    (`response(prompt,success:true)` etc, before `send()` returns. The HAPPY
#    PATH latency for that ack, per the raw captures, is ms-to-low-hundreds-
#    of-ms - but that is NOT the worst case (an earlier revision of this note
#    understated it as if it were). The WORST case is the full configured
#    `command_timeout_s` (30s by default): if pi is wedged, or the process
#    has died without the reader thread having noticed yet, `send()` blocks
#    for the entire timeout before raising. This is consistent with the port
#    docstring's letter - `send()`'s RETURN VALUE never carries the reply,
#    which is the contract's actual promise - but it is a real, and in the
#    worst case NOT small, blocking window `codex.py` does not have,
#    traded deliberately for immediate rejection evidence. ID-less versions
#    additionally serialize these waits for correlation. (The child-death
#    sub-case of this worst case is
#    now bounded much tighter in practice by the M1/M2 fixes in note 10:
#    a detected child exit fails every pending `request()` immediately
#    rather than waiting out the full timeout.)
#
# 9. DEFECT FOUND IN REVIEW, FIXED - recorded because it is the single most
#    valuable thing an integrator of this connector needs to know. The
#    first version of `PiRpcConnector.events()` was an UNBOUNDED
#    `self._event_queue.get()` loop, terminated by a single sentinel object
#    (`_SHUTDOWN`) pushed once by `close()`/an unexpected child exit. A
#    plain `Queue` sentinel is SINGLE-CONSUMPTION: only the ONE generator
#    instance whose `get()` happens to dequeue it ever sees it. A test that
#    called `connector.events()` a second time after a first caller (a
#    background pump thread inside a test helper) had already drained that
#    sentinel hung for 17 REAL minutes on an unbounded wait with no timeout
#    at all and no `pi` process anywhere in sight - exactly the "unbounded
#    queue.get() ... in the connector or your test double" hazard flagged in
#    this task's own brief, and it was real, not a flaky environment. Root
#    cause: a single-consumption shutdown signal is unsafe for a method that
#    a caller might reasonably invoke more than once (a supervisor retrying
#    after a reconnect, or - as here - two independent consumers of the same
#    connector's event stream). FIX: shutdown is now a `threading.Event`
#    (`_closed_event`), checked on every `queue.Empty` from a
#    `Queue.get(timeout=_EVENTS_POLL_S)` (module-level constant, currently
#    1.0s) rather than encoded as an item IN the queue at all - EVERY caller,
#    called ANY number of times, from ANY thread, now observes shutdown
#    within one poll period, and the "no polling for events" property (D1)
#    is preserved because real events still satisfy `get()` immediately;
#    only the IDLE-shutdown-detection path is bounded-and-rechecked instead
#    of unbounded. `_PiTransport.request()`'s `_request_lock` acquisition
#    was also changed from a bare `with` (implicitly bounded only via the
#    lock-holder's own eventual timeout) to an explicit
#    `acquire(timeout=timeout_s)` that raises `INTERNAL_ERROR` on expiry,
#    for the same reason: every blocking wait in this module now has an
#    explicit, own timeout, not a transitive one.
#
# 10. FIVE MORE DEFECTS FOUND IN ADVERSARIAL REVIEW, FIXED - a second pass
#    after note 9, all reproduced with a failing test before the fix:
#    a) C1 - the fake server this module's own test file used to simulate pi
#       answered `response(abort,success:true)` THE INSTANT it read the
#       abort command, then completed the aborted turn (`agent_settled`)
#       ~20ms later. Our OWN captured protocol reference (§6(b)) proves the
#       REAL wire order is the opposite: `agent_settled` for the aborted
#       turn arrives BEFORE the ack. Rebuilding the fake to match the real
#       order made `test_interrupt_blocks_further_sends_until_agent_settled`
#       and `test_second_interrupt_while_awaiting_settle_raises_conflict`
#       both fail immediately (interrupt() returned with the gate already
#       clear, because on the real reader thread the settle event is
#       dispatched - and clears the gate - before the ack line is even
#       read). Those two tests were rewritten to assert what is actually
#       true given the real order (a reprompt immediately after interrupt()
#       returns CAN legitimately succeed, since agent_settled - the
#       semantically correct gate per §6(b) - already fired) and to instead
#       prove the gate holds DURING the real race window: while `interrupt()`
#       is still blocked waiting on the delayed ack, a concurrent send_turn
#       from another thread must get CONFLICT. `_awaiting_settle` was also
#       promoted from a bare bool to a generation token (see its declaration
#       on `__init__`) so `_interrupt` can roll back its OWN pending state on
#       failure (feeds into M1 below) without ambiguity about which
#       "settle-wait" it is clearing.
#    b) C2 - `events()` fed every caller off ONE shared `queue.Queue`: two
#       concurrent consumers split the stream, each seeing an unpredictable
#       subset, contradicting this module's own note-9-era claim that a
#       second/later `events()` call is an independent, safe consumer.
#       Reproduced: after one `send_turn`, two threads each calling
#       `events()` - thread A got all 17 events through `agent_settled`,
#       thread B got ZERO and was still blocked after an 8s join. FIX:
#       fan-out - `_event_history` (append-only) plus one subscriber queue
#       per `events()` call, race-free by construction (see `_push_event`).
#    c) C3 - a failed `start()` called `transport.close()`, which only sets
#       the TRANSPORT's own `_closed` Event, never the CONNECTOR's separate
#       `_closed_event` that `events()` actually checks. Reproduced: a fake
#       pi that never acks `get_state` made `start()` raise `INTERNAL_ERROR`
#       as expected, then `list(conn.events())` did not finish in 5s - the
#       SAME unbounded-wait class note 9 fixed, reintroduced via a second,
#       untested exit path. FIX: `start()`'s except clause now sets
#       `_closed_event` too, and was widened from `except NativeAdapterError`
#       to `except BaseException` (and now wraps `transport.start()` itself,
#       not just the readiness probe) so no way of failing to start leaves
#       this gap open again.
#    d) M1 - `_interrupt` set the settle-wait gate BEFORE writing `abort`,
#       then blocked on the ack; if that raised (e.g. a timeout), the
#       function exited via the exception and never reached the code that
#       would have cleared the gate. Reproduced with a fake pi that accepts
#       abort but never answers it: `interrupt()` timed out, the gate stayed
#       set, and every subsequent `send_turn`/`interrupt` raised `CONFLICT`
#       forever - even though `CONFLICT`'s own message promises a retry
#       after the next `agent_settled`, which was never coming, and pi
#       itself was alive and reachable throughout. FIX: `_interrupt` now
#       wraps the abort `request()` in try/except and rolls its own
#       generation back on ANY exception before re-raising.
#    e) M2 - `_on_child_exit` never drained `_PiTransport._pending` nor
#       closed the transport, so a caller blocked in `request()` waited out
#       the FULL `command_timeout_s` even though the reader thread detected
#       the child's exit immediately. Reproduced: a fake pi that
#       `os._exit()`s the instant it reads `abort`, with
#       `command_timeout_s=2.0` - `send(interrupt)` took the full 2.0s to
#       raise instead of failing within milliseconds of the exit being
#       detected. FIX: `_read_stdout`'s exit path now fails every pending
#       `request()` immediately (`_fail_all_pending`, factored out of and
#       shared with `close()`) before invoking the `on_child_exit` callback.
